epsilon-greedy
==============

To run a simple test
  * bundle install
  * cd server
  * ruby server.rb
  * in a browser go to: http://localhost:4567/test
  * in another browser tab go to: http://localhost:4567/test/stats

You should start to see the graphs form as the epsilon-greedy algorithm picks forms. 

To reset, delete output.csv and git checkout server/test.yaml
